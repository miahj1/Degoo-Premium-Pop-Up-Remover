# Degoo Premium Pop-Up Remover
The platform Degoo used to allow free users to use their web application, but all of a sudden they took away that ability. When I want to view my images, I have to face an annoying pop-up that states that I must buy premium to use the desktop application. I created this script to prevent the pop-up from appearing allowing normal usage of the application.
